The Online Voting System is a web-based application designed to facilitate secure and efficient voting processes for various elections, such as government elections, organizational elections, or opinion polls. The system aims to provide a convenient and reliable platform for voters to cast their votes remotely, ensuring transparency, accuracy, and integrity of the voting process.

## Project Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented following a modular approach, with the goal of completing the implementation within 4 days. The plan for each day is as follows:

### Day 1:
- Set up the development environment.
- Design and create the necessary database schema for voters, elections, candidates, and votes.
- Implement the data access layer using Java JDBC for basic CRUD operations.

### Day 2:
- Implement the business logic layer to handle operations such as voter registration, login, candidate management, and voting.
- Implement validation and error handling for input data.

### Day 3:
- Implement the user interface Using Console Inputs.
- Integrate the user interface with the backend logic.
- Implement user interface functionalities such as user registration, login, viewing elections, and casting votes.

### Day 4:
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for administrators and voters.
- Implement additional features (optional) such as real-time voting updates, secure result announcements, etc.
- Perform comprehensive testing, including functional, usability, and security testing.
- Document the system's architecture, components, and functionalities.
